This repository contains all the files of the soldering station project.
For my first-year project in PXL, where I'm studying electronics and ICT, we were given an exciting assignment for the "Project Design" course. The task involved creating a complete project that encompassed designing a PCB, soldering it, and constructing a custom case for the PCB. As part of this assignment, I decided to design a unique soldering station with a LEGO theme, making the case modular and resembling a grey LEGO brick at its core.

To bring this project to life, I have compiled all the necessary files in a comprehensive repository. Within this repository, you will find the 3D printing files, PCB files, and detailed schematics for the PCB. Each component has been carefully documented to ensure seamless replication and assembly of the soldering station.

By infusing the project with a LEGO theme, I aimed to create a visually appealing and customizable soldering station that reflects my passion for electronics and ICT. The modular design allows for flexibility and future expansions, giving it a unique edge over traditional soldering stations.

Feel free to explore the repository and delve into the intricacies of my project. Should you have any questions or require further information, please don't hesitate to reach out.
